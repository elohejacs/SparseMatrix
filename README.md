# Sparse matrix project in JavaScript

MUST READ: This assignment i was working on memory management of Sparse matrix in JavaScript using only basic language features — no external libraries or matrix frameworks were used and no Ai was used. the program reads two sparse matrix files and performs mathematical operations ( add,  subtract , multiply), and show the results

---

## Here are some features of it

- Custom `SparseMatrix` class (which also i created and has no built-in matrix libraries)
- File parsing i did without regex — i tried to do my best to use string functions
- i made it to support:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
- Clear and user-friendly with calm messages and error messages
