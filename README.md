# Sparse matrix work in JavaScript

Note: In this assignment i was working on memory management of Sparse matrix in JavaScript using only basic language features — no external libraries or matrix frameworks were used and no Ai was used. so this program reads two sparse matrix files and performs operations  add,  subtract , multiply , and show the results in result_matrix.txt file

---

## Here are some features of it

- Custom `Spmatrix` class (which also i created and has no built-in matrix libraries)
- File parsing i did that without regex — and tried to do my best to using just normal string functions
- i made it to support:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
- i tried using clear and user friendly calm messages/ error messages
