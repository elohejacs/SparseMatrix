# Sparse Matrix Project in JavaScript

MUST READ: This project work with a memory management of Sparse Matrix in JavaScript using only basic language features â€” no external libraries or matrix frameworks plus no Ai was used to finish the whole task. The program reads two sparse matrix files and performs mathematical operations ( add,  subtract , multiply), and outputs the result to a file which is the result_matrix.txt

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Custom `SparseMatrix` class (which also i created and has no built-in matrix libraries)
- File parsing i did without regex â€” i tried to do my best to use string functions
- i made it to support:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
- Clear and user-friendly with calm messages and error messages
